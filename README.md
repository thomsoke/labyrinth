Enter the Labyrinth


PURPOSE:
This text-based game uses pointer-linked spaces to create spaces/rooms for player to move through and interact with.
Utilizes class inheritance and polymorphism to create spaces/rooms of different types, with unique features.


GAMEPLAY:
Player must navigate through the labyrinth rooms, eventually coming to the final room which contains a minotaur. In order to fight the minotaur, the user must have successfully collected 3 items that are found in various rooms. There is also an optional item that increases the player's likelihood of winning. There is no map displayed to user, to increase the labyrinthian feel of the game without making it unnecessarily complex. The required items is also not directly communicated to the player, with the intent of sending the user back out into the labyrinth and increasing its difficulty.
